# Weather-App
This is a project that displays current weather. It uses OpenWeatherAPI to fetch current weather in Krak√≥w, Poland. It exposes endpoints that allow the user to see what to wear given the weather, as well as submit feedback based on these recommendations which is later saved to the sqlite database
